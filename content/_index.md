# Overview

This workshop is intended for software developers with some experience building web applications to learn how to build a full stack cloud application with React, GraphQL, & Amplify . Everything we'll build during the workshop is eligible for AWS's free-tier pricing, however to ensure you don't incur any unexpected costs, be sure to follow the instructions in the cleanup section and remove all the resources you've created.

An understanding of software development and prior experience with the React framework are recommended but not required. Allow around two hours to get through all of the content, and slightly longer if you want to tackle the Extra Credit section!
