**AWS Amplify** streamlines full-stack app development. With its libraries, CLI, and services, you can easily connect your frontend to the cloud for authentication, storage, APIs, and more.

Amplify empowers developers with a flexible collection of modular cloud services and libraries for fullstack application development.

A developer could use Amplify’s data functionality for their fullstack app’s backend and frontend, just host their app’s frontend, or connect their user interface to an existing AWS resource like an Amazon S3 bucket.
Amplify provides tooling for building app backends, connecting app frontend to backend resources, and hosting frontend apps.
